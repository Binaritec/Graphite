- The team has grown from 1 to 5 in the past month and major progress was made building core architectural Rust code. A large accomplishment was designing the software architecture diagram.
- The current editor now has functional Select, Rectangle, and Ellipse tools thanks to the newly-added tool state machine and SVG viewport drawing. The UI now also implements tool-related icons and buttons, bringing it closer to parity with the design mockup. The team also set up a Web/Rust-WASM build system, GitHub CI to confirm PRs compile, and put together starter documentation for the codebase, UX design, and manual.
- Graphite is making rapid progress towards becoming a nondestructive, procedural graphics editor suitable of replacing traditional 2D DCC applications. Please [join the Discord](https://discord.graphite.rs) - and consider asking for a tour of the code and how you can help!
